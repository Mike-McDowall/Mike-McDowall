# HELLO
I'm a keen coder with a background in TV production and am planning to lauch a new tech start up to build apps related to journalism, media, and the travel industry.
 
## PROJECTS
I've worked up numerous coding projects since Sept 2023.
Most of them are currently 'private' but if you would like to check any of them out, please drop me a line at:

## 1)  Coderati
This is my capstone project from a Sortware Engineering course that I took at BrianStation, London.

CODERATI is a recruitment application that connects skilled coders with the companies that need to hire them. 
Its goal is to address the fact that tech jobs are scattered over internet, often on websites that don’t specialise in coding. 
It’s a React app with Express on the server side and it uses a great API called JSearch. 
As well as making job hunting easier for coders, it also features a database of tech experts, so that recruiters can headhunt in one tidy, convenient place.  

Check out this video if you would like to see a demo of the working app:

## 2)  Road Trip Planner
This is a web app built in javascript and HTML that automatically creates bespoke itineraries for travellers, including route planning and accommodation finding.
It's a work in progress but the functionality is already sorted. Next steps - polish the design and user experience.


## 3)  AI Fact Checker
This web app is written in Python. 
It's designed for TV producers and journalists who need to check the veracity of their scripts and articles.
Using an OpenAI API, it scans documents for facts and claims, and then searches the internet for sources - reducing the time consuming task of fact-checking to a matter of seconds. 
This is also a work in progress. The document analysis works well. Now I need to create a simple but elegant GUI, and I need to work up the web scraping.


## 4)  Back Of The Net
This is a football quiz game.  It was done for a 24hr hackathon that I team up with my colleague Alex Ross on.
It's a simple concept - guess the top scorer in any any league in the world, in any season on record.
The app uses an API to fetch the football stats, and has a database of contestants.


## 5)  In Stock
This was a week long project conducted in teams. I focussed on the back end  


## 6)  Brainflix
This is one of my early college projects.  It's a React app that uses Express on the server side and has a JSON database.


## 7)  Tastemakers
This was another 24hr hackathon project I took part in while on the BrainStation Software Engineering course.
There were teams of five, and we had just a single day to revamp DELIVEROO's drive into the gifting market.
Teams combined UX designers and software engineers, and my team won!
